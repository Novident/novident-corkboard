Novident give us a corkboard that is the key visual tool for organizing and structuring writing projects, such as novels, essays, screenplays, or research. Its design mimics a traditional corkboard with index cards, where each card can represents a section, chapter, scene, or idea from your project.

## 💡 What is Corkboard?

- **Visual Tabs:** Each tab displays can displays the content associated with the Node passed. For example, in a novel, each tab could be a scene with notes about its plot or characters.

- **Flexibility:** Tabs can be rearranged by dragging and dropping, allowing you to experiment with the structure of your project without altering the entire text.

- **Integration:** Each tab is linked to a Node within the novident-nodes implementation.

## 📌 Corkboard Modes

Novident offers three main working modes, which complement Corkboard:

### 🗒️ Corkboard (Cards Mode)

Classic view of cards organized on a board. 

Ideal for visually planning and reordering sections. You can filter cards using `customFilters` (useful for large projects).

### 🗒️ Free Form Corkboard

Ideal for visually a free reordering sections without offset limits.

### 🗃️ Outliner (Outline Mode)

Displays the structure as a hierarchical list, with details such as target words, dates, or metadata. Perfect for a more detailed, textual view of the project's order.

### 📝 Editor (Writing Mode)

Focuses on writing the text associated with a specific card.

Allows you to work without distractions on the content of each section.
